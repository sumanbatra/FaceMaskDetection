# FaceMaskDetection
The global health crises caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected a million of people and industries. The situation reports of World Health 
Organization (WHO) presented that COVID-19 has globally infected over 90 million people and caused over 2,093,581 deaths till date. We want to build a system that 
can detect the faces in images or videos and if the face has a mask on it or not. Amid this COVID-19, we can use it in local businesses to prevent the spread of 
COVID by warning people about their safety. On a large scale, we can integrate the system with security cameras in places like shopping malls, big companies so as 
to only allow the people that are wearing a mask to enter the premises.

The dataset for the project has been taken from Kaggle. The project leverages Computer Vision and Deep Neural Networks for the detection of the mask. The development
of the project is done in Google Collab for better and fast processing.

Verification Methods: For verification of our system, we will calculate the accuracy, loss metrics in the test set. We will then compare these values
with those obtained during the training of our machine learning model to evaluate if our Machine Learning model is underfitting or overfitting the data.



At this point of time the project is ongoing.
